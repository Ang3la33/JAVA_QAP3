Problem 1 and Problem 2 each took approximately an hour to complete. Problem 3 took approximately an hour and a half and Problem 4 took half an hour. The resources used include 
class lectures, google, and referencing the class github code example repo. Problems 1 and 2 were both relatively easy, Problems 3 and 4 were a bit trickier. After completing this
QAP I feel much more confident to solve similar problems in the future.
